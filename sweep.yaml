description: >
  MOONLAPSED/xongptsh is a low-level unix-only BASH/Python/C/KUBERNETES/Docker project involving NLP, chatbots, AI agents, and Linux File System (LFS) objects (including the whole gamut from basic cli and dir navigation to custom unit and systemd process files and kernel-level code). All attempts are made, in all situations, to NOT import code including libraries. Strong, strong preference is given to implementations using standard libraries in all but egregious situations. Utilizing SQLite3 and systemd, xongptsh suspends the unix environment around an llvmLLMcompilinker model agent trained on system and kernel, compiler code (gcc), and ELF files. Feel free to put quotes around any of these statements and treat them as inspirational rather than directional, I still have a lot of work to do but I want a test-passing, workflow-utilizing, modern CI/CD repo despite the immaturity of this particular project because bots and agents are offered limited autonomy inside this repo. Adhere to github and python application best practices.

sandbox:
  install:
    - trunk init
  check:
    - trunk fmt {file_path}
    - trunk check --fix {file_path}

rules:
- All docstrings and comments should be up to date.
- Include docstrings for both your module and any public functions within it so users know what the code does and how to use it.
- Leftover TODOs in the code should be handled.
- All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests in the tests/ directory.
- Any clearly inefficient or repeated code should be optimized or refactored.
- Consumer hardware limitations
- Leftover TODOs in the code should be handled.
- Scope limited to text files and Markdown (SQLite3 db - BLOBSs will be allowed in the special case of embeddings)
- Command line interfaces or CLI for accessibility
- When printing debug information, consider redirecting all messages to a log file so that logs are saved permanently.
- Rate limiting policies
- Implement retries with exponential backoff
- Consistent with PEP8 style guide
- rapidAPI/Swagger documentation
- Loose coupling between modules
- Consistent with PEP8 style guide
- Return Codes - see example returncode.schema.py
- SQL database - see schema.sql
- "Return Codes - see example returncode.schema.py"
- "SQL database - see schema.sql"
